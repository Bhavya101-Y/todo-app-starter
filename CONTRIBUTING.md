## Contributing to the Todo App on GitHub with VS Code | LetsUpgrade JS Bootcamp

This tutorial guides you, a beginner JS Bootcamp developer, through contributing to the Todo app on GitHub (https://github.com/PreetishPriyadarshi/todo-app-starter.git), specifically the starter-html-css branch. You'll learn how to use VS Code to make changes, create a pull request, and potentially see your contribution merged into the project!

**Prerequisites:**

* A GitHub account (free to create at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)
* Visual Studio Code installed on your computer (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

**Pick Color Palette for app:** https://coolors.co/palettes

**Steps:**

**Fork the Repository:**

1. Visit the Todo app repository: https://github.com/PreetishPriyadarshi/todo-app-starter.git
2. Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

**Clone Your Fork to VS Code:**

1. In a web browser, navigate to your forked repository (e.g., https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/todo-app-starter.git).
2. Click on the green "Code" button and choose "Clone with HTTPS." This displays the URL you'll need.
3. In VS Code:
    * Open VS Code.
    * Go to the "Source Control" tab (usually on the left-hand side).
    * Click on the "+" icon in the Source Control tab and select "Clone Repository."
    * Paste the URL from GitHub into the "URL" field.
    * Choose a local folder on your computer where you want to download the code (e.g., Documents/todo-app). Click "Clone."

**Understanding the Code:**

* Open the `index.html` file. This is the main HTML document that defines the structure of the Todo app.
* Open the `style.css` file. This file contains the CSS styles that control the appearance of your app's elements.
* Review the `README.md` file for any specific contribution guidelines.

**Make Your Changes:**

* It's recommended to work on the `starter-html-css` branch to avoid conflicts with the main repository. You can switch branches in VS Code using the Source Control tab.
* Use VS Code's editing features to modify the HTML or CSS code. Consider adding new features, styling elements differently, or improving the general layout.
* **Important:** Focus on contributing to the HTML and CSS for this stage. We'll leave JavaScript for a future contribution!

**Commit Your Changes:**

1. Once you're happy with your changes, stage them for a commit using the Source Control tab.
2. Click on the "+" icon next to the changed files.
3. Type a clear and concise commit message that describes your changes (e.g., "Added strikethrough style for completed tasks").
4. Click on the green "Commit" button to create a snapshot of your changes.

**Push Your Changes to Your Fork:**

In the Source Control tab, find the "Push" button under your remote repository (usually named origin). Click it to push your committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

**Create a Pull Request:**

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub (https://github.com/topics/todo-app).
2. Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
3. Click on the green "New pull request" button.
4. Select the `starter-html-css` branch (your branch with changes) as the "head branch" and `starter-html-css` (the main branch) as the "base branch." This tells GitHub that you're proposing changes to be merged into the main repository's `starter-html-css` branch.
5. Give your pull request a clear and descriptive title (e.g., "Improved styling for completed tasks").
6. Optionally, add a brief description in the body explaining your changes.
7. Click on the green "Create pull request" button.

**Review and Merge:**

The maintainers of the main repository will review your pull request. Respond to any comments or questions they may have.
If your changes are approved, they will merge your pull request, integrating your contribution into the `starter-html-css` branch!
Congratulations!
